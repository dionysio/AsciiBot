### About
AsciiBot is a simple reddit bot which tries to find ASCII art/shibe/code in reddit comments. It takes screenshot of those kinds of comments and uploads it to imgur.com. Reasoning behind this is that mobile users have problems with those kinds of content.

Currently this script runs on reddit as /u/ScreenshotsYourPost. 

### Setup
Fill out constants in config.py and then just run bot.py
